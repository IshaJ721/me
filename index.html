        <h3>Why do you want to join Texas Bluebonnets?</h3>
        <p>As a sophomore, I want to meet people outside my major that value the same things as me, and I think the pillars in CLASS fulfill that perfectly. This was the one place, at your info sessions, that I felt was genuine, because I'm an introvert and you all truly made me feel comfy being myself. Beyond my roomies, I would love to find a group of cuties who I can call family to do cutie activities with! &lt;3</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Core Pillar</h3>
        <p>I'm really passionate about youth literacy after volunteer tutoring for years and I’m grateful to have grown up with an emphasis on the value of education. Realizing that illiteracy is a widespread epidemic made me want to advocate for it, by speaking at a TEDxYouth event and how technology can help us solve it together. Similarly, I also have spent many hours at the North Texas Food bank with my family and have continued that path of aiding food insecurity here at UT, through an org called ATX Food Hub. As the map improvement lead, we were able to provide a centralized hub to consolidate discounted/free food resources for students and Austinites– that’s why I’m especially excited if I continued that journey with Bluebonnets with Sunday Lunchbox. Additionally, I’m currently part of Project Advance Austin's working with the Dress for Success nonprofit for helping women achieve their professional dreams. I'm majoring in computer science simply because I want to develop tech to improve the everyday lives of people and that's honestly my life goal.</p>

        <h3>Most passionate right now</h3>
        <p>I’m passionate about living life to the fullest before I’m stuck in a corporate job (the 9-5 is overrated 🤨). Along those lines, I’m trying to find my personal brand and make time to find joy in the small things even with a busy schedule. For instance, I designed my room in my apartment (my first one 🥹) with a sage green theme, leaf fairy lights, and wooden/gold accents. I personally painted my decor on canvas and reconnecting with my creative side made me really happy– we get too caught up in life sometimes to make time for relaxing hobbies.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>If you could write a book</h3>
        <p>My lifelong dream has been to write a book– I’m a HUGE fiction reader, especially fantasy, dystopia, sci-fi, and romance. Later in life, I would love to move to some remote town in Europe (Italy is a strong contender?? 😁) and write my novel in some small cottage and maybe do my tech job remotely. I would write an awesome sci-fi romance, the next Hunger Games or Fourth Wing– I’m always open to good book recs– and I live for a good plot. I’d probably write a romance set in space with some astronauts– I especially love Ali Hazelwood’s style of bridging romance and women in STEM for nerds like me 😋so I would probably implement something similar.</p>

  <!-- Quick Questions -->
  <section class="tab-page" id="quick">
    <h2>Quick Questions</h2>
    <div class="card-grid">
      <div class="card"><p><strong>Favorite thing about yourself:</strong> Spontaneity– because it enables me to make time for the people I care about, and makes the small things feel super special. For example, when my high school friend visited UT for the first time last semester, I turned Top Golf and Taco Bell into her first nightly college adventure, and I’m incredibly grateful that she will always take that memory with her.</p></div>
      <div class="card polaroid"><img src="biriyani.JPG" alt="Biriyani"><p>Food vibes 🍽️</p></div>
      <div class="card polaroid"><img src="chai.JPG" alt="Chai"><p>Cozy chai ☕</p></div>
      <div class="card polaroid"><img src="holi.JPG" alt="Holi"><p>Festival fun 🌸</p></div>
      <div class="card"><p><strong>Travel anywhere:</strong> I would go to a remote beach. There’s something so calming about the ocean– it reminds me of my childhood in Jersey. Plus, I will never say no to a swim #ilovebartonsprings</p></div>
      <div class="card"><p><strong>Best advice:</strong> YOLO because I've always aspired to live my life that way. Whenever I’m debating spending money or time on some experience, my roommate always tells me you only live once. Because money comes back but experiences don’t– I find that mindset so endearing especially when it’s so unreasonable 😅. I define my life by being spontaneous (shoutout to my roomies who introduced me to the idea of study dates/cafe hopping on a random Tuesday). And I think regardless of the additional work or time commitment or cost, nothing replicates the memories and happiness you’ll get from quality time.</p></div>
      <div class="card"><p><strong>Music:</strong> Throwback :)) I love old Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, etc– basically songs to scream in the shower. I’ve been really into indie artists recently and I also love Bollywood music <3.</p></div>
      <div class="card"><p><strong>$1000 spend:</strong> Food, obviously heheh– but more realistically, people. My love language is gift giving and one of my favorite gifts ever was my first pair of crocs (pink!) for my 18th birthday because my friend knew I’ve never worn them before– thoughtfulness is what drives all my friendships. Just yesterday we bought my roommate a gift basket because she was overwhelmed with org work :( Overall, I love putting a smile on my friends’ faces.</p></div>
      <div class="card"><p><strong>Animal fight:</strong> A mouse because did Tom ever really catch up to Jerry?? Plus they're too cute to eat. Everyone would take pity on them.</p></div>
      <div class="card"><p><strong>Victorian Era item:</strong> Hear me out– a vibrator in the Victorian Era would be novel. It’s this tiny gadget that basically says, ‘Women don’t need a man to get stuff done.’ Super compact, totally efficient, and honestly kind of empowering…</p></div>
      <div class="card"><p><strong>Death row meal:</strong> Hard to choose– pasta because who doesn’t love a good creamy fettuccine? And of course, my mom’s chicken biriyani because I LOVE spice, and chocolate cake because I NEVER forget dessert 😋</p></div>
      <div class="card"><p><strong>Most likely to…</strong> accidentally throw my phone in the trash can or dryer (true stories) or something else horrendously stupid 😅</p></div>
      <div class="card"><p><strong>Favorite emoji:</strong> 😚😋because I use the second one to express my happiness, and the first to express my gratitude or love.</p></div>
