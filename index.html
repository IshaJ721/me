        <h2>Short Answers ✍️ (≤250 words)</h2>

        <h3>Why do you want to join Texas Bluebonnets?</h3>
        <p class="answer">
          As a sophomore, I want to meet people outside my major that value the same things as me, and I think CLASS fulfills that perfectly. This was the one place, at your info sessions, that I felt was genuine because I'm an introvert and you all truly made me feel comfy being myself.
        </p>

        <h3>Pick one core pillar — Service (how I embody it)</h3>
        <p class="answer">
          I'm really passionate about youth literacy after volunteer tutoring for years and I’m grateful to have grown up emphasizing the value of education. Realizing that illiteracy is an epidemic made me want to advocate for it, through a TEDxYouth event. I also have spent many hours at the North Texas Food bank with my family and have continued that path of aiding food insecurity here at UT, through an org called ATX Food Hub. As the map improvement lead, we were able to provide a centralized hub to consolidate discounted/free food resources for students and Austinites– that’s why I’m especially excited if I continued that journey with Bluebonnets. Additionally, I’m currently redesigning Project Advance Austin that’s working with the Dress for Success nonprofit.
        </p>

        <h3>Pick 2 short prompts (≤200 words each)</h3>
        <strong>What do you value most in a friendship?</strong>
        <p class="answer">Being genuine — because I'm an introvert and it's so hard to open up to people who I don't feel are being genuine :(</p>

        <strong>What are you most passionate about in your life right now?</strong>
        <p class="answer">Living life to the fullest before I’m stuck in a corporate job.</p>
