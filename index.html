    <!-- Why join -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Why do you want to join Texas Bluebonnets?</h2>
      <p>As a sophomore, I want to meet people outside my major that value the same things as me, and I think the pillars in CLASS fulfill that perfectly. This was the one place, at your info sessions, that I felt was genuine, because I'm an introvert and you all truly made me feel comfy being myself. Beyond my roomies, I would love to find a group of cuties who I can call family to do cutie activities with! <3</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Pillar -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Core Pillar</h2>
      <p>I'm really passionate about youth literacy after volunteer tutoring for years and Iâ€™m grateful to have grown up with an emphasis on the value of education. Realizing that illiteracy is a widespread epidemic made me want to advocate for it, by speaking at a TEDxYouth event and how technology can help us solve it together. Similarly, I also have spent many hours at the North Texas Food bank with my family and have continued that path of aiding food insecurity here at UT, through an org called ATX Food Hub. As the map improvement lead, we were able to provide a centralized hub to consolidate discounted/free food resources for students and Austinitesâ€“ thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m especially excited if I continued that journey with Bluebonnets with Sunday Lunchbox. Additionally, Iâ€™m currently part of Project Advance Austin's working with the Dress for Success nonprofit for helping women achieve their professional dreams. I'm majoring in computer science simply because I want to develop tech to improve the everyday lives of people and that's honestly my life goal.</p>
