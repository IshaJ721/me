      <h2>Why do you want to join Texas Bluebonnets?</h2>
      <p>As a sophomore, I want to meet people outside my major that value the same things as me, and I think the pillars in CLASS fulfill that perfectly. This was the one place, at your info sessions, that I felt was genuine, because I'm an introvert and you all truly made me feel comfy being myself. Beyond my roomies, I would love to find a group of cuties who I can call family to do cutie activities with! <3</p>

      <h2>Core Pillar</h2>
      <p>I'm really passionate about youth literacy after volunteer tutoring for years and Iâ€™m grateful to have grown up with an emphasis on the value of education. Realizing that illiteracy is a widespread epidemic made me want to advocate for it, by speaking at a TEDxYouth event and how technology can help us solve it together. Similarly, I also have spent many hours at the North Texas Food bank with my family and have continued that path of aiding food insecurity here at UT, through an org called ATX Food Hub. As the map improvement lead, we were able to provide a centralized hub to consolidate discounted/free food resources for students and Austinitesâ€“ thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m especially excited if I continued that journey with Bluebonnets with Sunday Lunchbox. Additionally, Iâ€™m currently part of Project Advance Austin's working with the Dress for Success nonprofit for helping women achieve their professional dreams. I'm majoring in computer science simply because I want to develop tech to improve the everyday lives of people and that's honestly my life goal.</p>

      <h2>Quick Questions</h2>
      <p><strong>Favorite thing about yourself:</strong> Spontaneityâ€“ because it enables me to make time for the people I care about, and makes the small things feel super special. For example, when my high school friend visited UT for the first time last semester, I turned Top Golf and Taco Bell into her first nightly college adventure, and Iâ€™m incredibly grateful that she will always take that memory with her.</p>
      <p><strong>Travel:</strong> I would go to a remote beach. Thereâ€™s something so calming about the oceanâ€“ it reminds me of my childhood in Jersey. Plus, I will never say no to a swim #ilovebartonsprings</p>
      <p><strong>Best advice:</strong> YOLO because I've always aspired to live my life that way. Whenever Iâ€™m debating spending money or time on some experience, my roommate always tells me you only live once. Because money comes back but experiences donâ€™tâ€“ I find that mindset so endearing especially when itâ€™s so unreasonable ðŸ˜…. I define my life by being spontaneous (shoutout to my roomies who introduced me to the idea of study dates/cafe hopping on a random Tuesday). And I think regardless of the additional work or time commitment or cost, nothing replicates the memories and happiness youâ€™ll get from quality time.</p>
      <p><strong>Music:</strong> Throwback :)) I love old Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, etcâ€“ basically songs to scream in the shower. Iâ€™ve been really into indie artists recently and I also love Bollywood music <3.</p>
      <p><strong>1000 dollars:</strong> Food, obviously hehehâ€“ but more realistically, people. My love language is gift giving and one of my favorite gifts ever was my first pair of crocs (pink!) for my 18th birthday because my friend knew Iâ€™ve never worn them beforeâ€“ thoughtfulness is what drives all my friendships. Just yesterday we bought my roommate a gift basket because she was overwhelmed with org work :( Overall, I love putting a smile on my friendsâ€™ faces.</p>
      <p><strong>Animals fight:</strong> A mouse because did Tom ever really catch up to Jerry?? Plus they're too cute to eat. Everyone would take pity on them.</p>
      <p><strong>Victorian Era:</strong> Hear me outâ€“ a vibrator in the Victorian Era would be novel. Itâ€™s this tiny gadget that basically says, â€˜Women donâ€™t need a man to get stuff done.â€™ Super compact, totally efficient, and honestly kind of empoweringâ€¦</p>
      <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> accidentally throw my phone in the trash can or dryer (true stories) or something else horrendously stupid ðŸ˜…</p>
      <p><strong>Favorite emoji:</strong> ðŸ˜šðŸ˜‹because I use the second one to express my happiness, and the first to express my gratitude or love.</p>
