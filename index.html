        <h3>Why do you want to join Texas Bluebonnets?</h3>
        <p class="answer">
          As a sophomore, I want to meet people outside my major that value the same things as me, and I think CLASS fulfills that perfectly. This was the one place, at your info sessions, that I felt was genuine because I'm an introvert and you all truly made me feel comfy being myself.
        </p>

        <h3>Pick one core pillar — Service (how I embody it)</h3>
        <p class="answer">
          I'm really passionate about youth literacy after volunteer tutoring for years and I’m grateful to have grown up emphasizing the value of education. Realizing that illiteracy is an epidemic made me want to advocate for it, through a TEDxYouth event. I also have spent many hours at the North Texas Food bank with my family and have continued that path of aiding food insecurity here at UT, through an org called ATX Food Hub.

        <h3>Pick 2 short prompts (≤200 words each)</h3>
        <strong>What do you value most in a friendship?</strong>
        <p class="answer">Being genuine — because I'm an introvert and it's so hard to open up to people who I don't feel are being genuine :(</p>

        <strong>What are you most passionate about in your life right now?</strong>

service— I'm really passionate about youth literacy after volunteer tutoring for years and I’m grateful to have grown up emphasizing the value of education. Realizing that illiteracy is an epidemic made me want to advocate for it, through a TEDxYouth event. Similarly,  I also have spent many hours at the North Texas Food bank with my family and have continued that path of aiding food insecurity here at UT, through an org called ATX Food Hub. As the map improvement lead, we were able to provide a centralized hub to consolidate discounted/free food resources for students and Austinites– that’s why I’m especially excited if I continued that journey with Bluebonnets with Sunday Lunchbox. Additionally, I’m currently part of Project Advance Austin's working with the Dress for Success nonprofit for helping women achieve their professional dreams. I'm majoring in computer science simply because I want to develop tech to improve the everyday lives of people (sorry if I sound corny but its true) and thats kinda my life goal.

      <article class="note card tilt-right">
        <h2>Rapid Fire ⚡</h2>

        <p><strong>What is your favorite thing about yourself?</strong> Spontaneity — making time for people i care about</p>
        <p><strong>If you could travel anywhere right now:</strong> Remote mountains</p>
        <p><strong>Best piece of advice you've received:</strong> Yolo because ive always aspired to live my life that way but my friend (now one of my roommates) whenever I’m debating spending money on some experience she says yolo because money comes back but experiences don’t, being spontaneous, she’s so endearing. Sometimes i put myself thru a lot of work because nothing replicates the mems</p>
        <p><strong>What kind of music do you listen to when you’re in a great mood?</strong> Throwback :))</p>
        <p><strong>If you had 1000 dollars, what would you spend it on?</strong> Food. obviously &lt;3 people to be honest though my love language is gift giving and one of my fav gifts ever was my first pair of crocs (pink) for my 18th bday because my friend knew ive never worn them before</p>
        <p><strong>If all animals were the same size, what would win in a fight?</strong> A mouse bc did tom ever really catch up to jerry?? Plus they're too cute to eat everyone would take pity</p>
        <p><strong>If you could time travel to the Victorian Era, what modern item would you show them?</strong> A vibrator bc women can pleasure themselves and never rely on a man (women's sexual freedom) and independence</p>
        <p><strong>What would be your “death row meal?”</strong> Hard to choose, pasta because who doesn’t love a good creamy fettuccine? and my mom’s chicken biriyani LOVE me some spice, and chocolate cake because I NEVER forget dessert</p>
